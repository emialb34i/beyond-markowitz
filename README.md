I implemented the [Nested Clustered Optimization Algorithm (NCO)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469961) developed by Prof. Marcos Lopez De Prado. For further improvements I used a matrix denoising method implemented in the denoise.py file, more info can be found in Chapter 2 of this [book](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/machine-learning-for-asset-managers/6D9211305EA2E425D33A9F38D0AE3545). I also implemnted a new method to calculate expected returns using the results from [Martin (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12778) which use option price data (I used yahoo finance api) to calculate in real time the expected return on a stock. The denoised covariance and the options implied expected returns are fed into the NCO algorithm, theoretically this should provide a better allocation than the regular mean-variance optimization. The file main.py puts all three things together, the other files are self explenatory.
